LiveStreamer
============
A live video/audio streamer client

Preparation
-----------
* You should install *ffmpeg*, *libav-tools* before streaming. The script ```auto_prepare.sh``` does the job for you.
* In one script file, mostly for linux platform. This not works on ubuntu 14.04 very well.
* For live video streaming on twitch, you should have a twitch account and twitch_key stored in a file *twitch_key.txt* this folder.
